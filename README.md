# Terraform Synology Provider

This provider allows [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) to manage remote [Synology NAS](https://www.synology.com/dsm/solution/what-is-nas/for-home) server.


Currently, this repo contains only [API client](./synology-go/) to access remote NAS from Go code. The provider code is on its way.
